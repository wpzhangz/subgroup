# Block-learning Algorithm Code and Examples

The R scripts implement the proposed approach to reproduce the numerical results in section 5 and 6 of the paper “ Simultaneous subgroup identification and variable selection
for high dimensional data” by Yu, Wu and Zhang (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00180-023-01436-3).   The folder simulation contains R functions for the simulation studies in section 5.  The  folder lung data contains the R code and data sets used in section 3.2.
