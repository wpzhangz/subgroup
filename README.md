# The R scripts implement the proposed approach to reproduce the numerical results in sections 5 and 6 of the paper “ Simultaneous subgroup identification and variable selection for high dimensional data” by Yu, Wu and Zhang  (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00180-023-01436-3). 
The folder simulation contains R functions of the model proposed by us for the simulation studies in section 5. 
The folder FGSG contains R functions of the model FGSG for the simulation studies in section 5. 
The folder FMR contains R functions of the model SFMR for the simulation studies in section 5. 
The folder TFGSG contains R functions of the model TFGSG for the simulation studies in section 5. 
The folder lung data contains the R code and data sets used in section 6. The code consists of the following files: 

"APGL1.R"  functions used for simulation
"lungsim.R" estimate parameters for the lung data
"*_1.R" estimate parameters for case 1 of Study 1  in the simulations
"*_2.R" estimate parameters for case 2 of Study 1  in the simulations
"*_3.R" estimate parameters for case 3 of Study 1  in the simulations
"*_4.R" estimate parameters for case 4 of Study 1  in the simulations
"*_5.R" estimate parameters for case 1 of Study 2  in the simulations
"*_6.R" estimate parameters for case 2 of Study 2  in the simulations
"*_7.R" estimate parameters for case 3 of Study 2  in the simulations
